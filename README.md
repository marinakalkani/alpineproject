# alpineproject
This repository contains a Docker Compose configuration for a simple setup with Alpine, MySQL, and Redis.

## Alpine
*Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. Read more about Alpine Linux here and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.*
